####Summary
    Computer Science student at CAU. Highly motivated to start career in Software Development. RSS Javascript course is a great opportunity for me to do so. I am planning to find internship after completion of the course, but most importantly gain hard-skills in Javascript and experience of working in a group. I understand that here nobody will babyseat me and I have to work hard and learn fast but I am always ready for new challenges.
####Skills
    1. Algorithms and Data Structures
    2. Java syntax
    3. basic OOP concepts
    4. C++ (but only used for Algorhitms course I took at my school)
